## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Xcode 15.0 or later
*   iOS 16.0 or later
*   Zhipu AI API key (for AI features)

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SmartBookkeeping.git
    cd SmartBookkeeping
    ```
2.  Open `SmartBookkeeping.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3.  Configure your Zhipu AI API key in the app settings
4.  Build and run the app on a simulator or physical device

### Configuration

#### API Key Setup
To protect sensitive information, this project uses configuration files to manage API keys and other configuration data.

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Copy the example configuration file**
   ```bash
   cp SmartBookkeeping/Config.example.plist SmartBookkeeping/Config.plist
   ```

2. **Edit the configuration file**
   Open `SmartBookkeeping/Config.plist` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```xml
   <key>DefaultAPIKey</key>
   <string>your_actual_api_key</string>
   ```

3. **Get API Key**
   - Visit [Zhipu AI Open Platform](https://open.bigmodel.cn/)
   - Register an account and obtain an API key
   - Fill the key into the configuration file

**Configuration Files:**
- `Config.plist` - Actual configuration file (contains sensitive info, ignored by .gitignore)
- `Config.example.plist` - Example configuration file (safe to commit to version control)

**Important Notes:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `Config.plist` file contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control.
‚úÖ This file has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

**Default Configuration:**
If `Config.plist` is not found, the app will use these defaults:
- Base URL: `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`
- Model Name: `glm-4-air-250414`
- Free Uses: `50`
- API Key: None (requires manual configuration)

#### Other Settings
*   **AI API Setup:** Configure your Zhipu AI API key in Settings > API Configuration (alternative method)
*   **Permissions:** Grant microphone and photo library access for full functionality
*   **Categories:** Customize transaction categories to match your spending patterns
